# Student Directory #

The student directory Ruby script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at Villians Academy. This Command Line application was created as part of the Makers Academy pre-course.

## How to use ##

```
shell
ruby directory.rb
```
You can also add a .csv file after the `ruby directory.rb` (although there is functionality to load a .csv once inside the application).
